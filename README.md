(Br)azilian (u)nit (c)ommitment 

Real unit-commitment data is hard to come by. System operators are generally secretive about the data used for building their unit-commitment (UC) problems. Even when data is available, it is sometimes difficult to read, specially if one is not deeply familiar with the data-format used and the problem itself.

As a consequence of this lack of real data, researchers usually resort to synthetic systems, which might not accurately represent the difficulties of a real UC.

Thus, this Python package converts real input data used by the Brazilian Independent System Operator (ISO) for the UC into more friendly formats and builds the associated UC with gurobipy in an effort to reduce the gap between industry UCs and academic UCs.

Although the UC built with bruc is not exactly the one solved by the Brazilian ISO, it has all the components that make it a challenging optimization problem:

- Binary variables 
- Network 
- Hydro constraints

The optimization model built with bruc is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and it can be divided into three main components:

- Thermal model
- Hydro model 
- Network model

# Thermal model
Includes all constraints of the thermal generating units generally used in UC.
- Ramps
- Start-up and shut-down trajectories
- Minimum up and minimum down times
- Combined-cycle operation

# Hydro model
- Piecewise linear approximation of the hydropower function
- Spatial coupling 
- Pumping units
- 

# Network model
We use the common DC representation of the network.

The number of constraints and variables slightly varies with the test case used, an average of the model size is given below.

| Constraints | Continuous variables  | Binary variables  |
| :-----:     | :-:                   | :-:               |
| 687,653     | 714,145               | 55,440            |

Currently, we have 75 cases taken from early February 2021 up to late July 2022.
